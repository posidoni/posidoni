# Hi, my name is Mike!

I am a Software Engineer (Backend ‚Äî Go, TypeScript) with domain knowledge in FinTech, DeFi and e-commerce.

## Job

- Now I work at [Blum](https://t.me/Blum) in Telegram Mini App team. I am directly responsible for a wide range of TMA features and my work contributes to fair & responsible trading experience for crypto üòä

### Career highlights:

- Sharded a 1TB monolithic database into 24 shards without downtime.
- Acquired quite a strong expertise in professional optimization. Specifically,
I've optimized gRPC handlers and Kafka consumers/producers. Either by
low-level methods (pprof, metrics, etc.) or by refactoring architecture to
eliminate bottlenecks.

- I created and designed algorithmic copytraing system for a Base Chain (chain id 8453).
- Deployed 2 blockchains from scratch - bootnodes, light-node and RPC EVM nodes
on the base of AWS EC2 machines.

- I always loved to bypass antifrauds and begin career in tech based on that.
However, my dream basically came true and I've created an antifraud from scratch for
Avito - largest classifieds in the world. Specifically, I'm responsible for
hardcore research, design review, and implementation of antifraud of ~50%+
payment traffic.

- Throughout the years, I've became pretty good at the so called `DevSecOps` -
you can check out my linked in to see the work in this sphere. Honestly, I
believe this is what every developer had to do.

## Hobby

However, besides job stuff I feel like I actually deeply love what I'm doing :)

- I kind of share the philosophy of [Primigean](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen/videos) - the more you do something, the better you get at it, the more interesting it is to do it. I was lucky I had 0 'boring' projects ever, maybe besides a few very first educational ones (coding decimal library in C11 `decimal.h` with bit-shifts was a bit boring, but actually I've used `decimal` type every day at crypto. I think this is Karma üòÅ)

- [TJ](https://www.youtube.com/@teej_dv/videos), especially his PDE Talk and tutorials ~3 years ago inspired me to give NeoVim a chance. Since that I'm a happy user of Neovim. I definitely can appreciate other editors, but NeoVim is just so good/extensive (and I also like what the team is doing with architecture, RPC protocol, etc.), that I see no reason to change.

- [POV: I'm on my third coffee and you just asked me how the internet works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjKFXlFNR4E&t=231s&ab_channel=fasterthanlime)

- I have gave Nix & NixOS a fair change for 3 weeks, but I'm not sure they
  actually solve problems they actually solve problems they claim to solve.
  (maybe I missed proper intro by @alurm, who knows..)
